## Notes

I initially struggled with learning how everything in the app really worked, but over time I became familiar and was able to easily understand what aspect and what part I had to look for 
in various tasks to edit what I wanted to change. Also, there were a lot of JavaScript syntax that I had forgotten, but going through the resources really helped solidify my knowledge of JavaScript and web development in general.
